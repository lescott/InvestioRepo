Feedback from 6/6 Playtest:

- Make sure that the numbers update instantaneously (done!)
- Tilt and press to move screens as opposed to just tilt (done!)
- Put Sell and Buy on two ends of the screen, to cut down on amount of screens and to increase intuitiveness
- Put market price on each Buy/Sell screen
- Put Money on each screen (?)
- Check/test win condition
- Display money of each player at the end (done!)
